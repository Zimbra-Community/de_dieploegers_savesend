Introduction
************

This Zimlet for the Zimbra Collaboration Suite enables the user to change the 
Sent Folder while composing a message. This is helpful if you want to sort your
sent messages without having to create outgoing filters 
(available from 7.0 onwards).

**Warning:** This Zimlet currently doesn't work. It's waiting 
for `Bug #72463 <http://bugzilla.zimbra.com/show_bug.cgi?id=72463>`_ 
to be included.

Installation
************

Install this zimlet by using the Zimbra Web Console or the zmzimletctl cli-tool.
